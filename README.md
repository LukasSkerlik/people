CRUD app using firebase and react

edit: code test instructions:



Create a Firebase project.

Create a one-page React web app that uses Firestore to create a 'people' collection of documents.

The collection should be populated with person documents from a form in the UI.

Each person should have a 'firstName' and 'lastName' field.

The people collection should display as a list in the UI.

Each person in the list should be able to have its firstName and lastName field edited.

Each person in the list should be able to be deleted from the people collection.

The project should be hosted on Github.

Visual styling is not important, I'll just be looking at your general approach, project structure and code style.
